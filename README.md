# Solar-Swaraj-Inverter
This project models a home solar power system, simulating how a PV array captures sunlight and converts it to usable AC power. The system uses a DC-DC boost converter to increase the voltage and a DC-AC inverter to create the final AC output. Controlled by a PWM generator , it operates using realistic Indian solar data (289 W/m² at 30°C)
